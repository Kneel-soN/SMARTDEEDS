# SMARTDEEDS
I have used **Ganache** to test this smart contract if you don't have **Ganache**
you can install it with this link
: https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/

and you need to install **node.js** too:
https://nodejs.org/en
select the one based on your operating system

Use text editors like Visual Studio Code for easier installation of dependencies
2) In your termnial, to install the dependencies needed 
, do **npm install** 
 > or do **yarn install** if you prefer yarn to install the needed dependencies

3) Make your own private key/s in your .env file
